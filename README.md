# Pull Request Slack Notifier

[![ci](https://github.com/daint2git/pull-request-slack-notifier/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/daint2git/pull-request-slack-notifier/actions?query=workflow:ci)

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to send a message to a Slack channel when a pull request is `opened`, `reopened`, `merged`, `closed`, `commented`, `review commented`, `review approved` or `review dismissed`.

This package has two different techniques to send a message to Slack:

1. Send a message via a Slack app to post to a specific channel (use an existing custom app or create a new one).
1. Send a message via a Slack Incoming Webhook URL (use an existing custom app or create a new one).

The recommended way to use this action is with the Slack app.

## Techniques

### Technique 1: Slack App

By creating a new Slack app or using an existing one, this approach allows your GitHub Actions job to post a message in a Slack channel by utilizing the [Slack Web API](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending).

### Setup

- [Create a Slack App][apps] for your workspace (alternatively use an existing app you have already created and installed).
- Add [`chat.write`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/chat:write) and [`reactions:write`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/reactions:write) (optional) bot scope under **OAuth & Permissions**.
- Install the app to your workspace.
- Copy the app's Bot User OAuth Token from the **OAuth & Permissions** page and [add it as a secret in your repo settings][repo-secret] named `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.
- Copy the channel ID is displayed in the browser URL and [add it as a secret in your repo settings][repo-secret] named `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`. For example: `https://app.slack.com/client/TXXXXXXXXXX/DXXXXXXXXXX`, channel ID is `DXXXXXXXXXX`.
- Invite the bot user into the channel you wish to post messages to (you will type a message `/invite @bot_user_name`).

See more [details](https://api.slack.com/messaging/sending).

### Usage

You can use this action after any other action. Here is a simple example setup of this action:

1. Create a `.github/workflows/notify-pull-request-slack.yml` file in your GitHub repo.
1. Add the following code to the `notify-pull-request-slack.yml` file.

For a pull request is `opened`, `reopened`, `merged` or `closed`

```yml
name: Notify Pull Request Slack

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - closed

jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: daint2git/pull-request-slack-notifier@v1
        with:
          slack-bot-token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
          slack-channel-id: ${{ secrets.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID }}
          user-mapping: |
            {
              "GitHub username 1": "Slack member ID 1",
              "GitHub username 2": "Slack member ID 2"
            }
```

For a pull request is `commented`

```yml
name: Notify Pull Request Slack

on:
  issue_comment:
    types:
      - created
      - edited

jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: daint2git/pull-request-slack-notifier@v1
        with:
          slack-bot-token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
          slack-channel-id: ${{ secrets.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID }}
          user-mapping: |
            {
              "GitHub username 1": "Slack member ID 1",
              "GitHub username 2": "Slack member ID 2"
            }
```

For a pull request is `review commented`, `review approved` or `review dismissed`

```yml
name: Notify Pull Request Slack

on:
  pull_request_review:
    types:
      - submitted
      - edited
      - dismissed

jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: daint2git/pull-request-slack-notifier@v1
        with:
          slack-bot-token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
          slack-channel-id: ${{ secrets.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID }}
          user-mapping: |
            {
              "GitHub username 1": "Slack member ID 1",
              "GitHub username 2": "Slack member ID 2"
            }
```

Note that you can completely combine them together.

### Technique 2: Slack Incoming Webhook

By creating a new Slack app or using an existing one, this approach allows your GitHub Actions job to post a message to a Slack channel by utilizing [Slack Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

### Setup

- [Create a Slack App][apps] for your workspace (alternatively use an existing app you have already created and installed).
- Add the [`incoming-webhook`](https://api.slack.com/scopes/incoming-webhook) bot scope under **OAuth & Permissions**.
- Install the app to your workspace (you will select a channel to notify).
- Activate and create a new webhook under **Incoming Webhooks**.
- Copy the Webhook URL from the Webhook you just generated [add it as a secret in your repo settings][repo-secret] named `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.

See more [details](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

### Usage

Note that you need to provide at least one `slack-bot-token` input or `slack-webhook-url` input to run this action.

## Troubleshooting

To enable runner diagnostic logging set the `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` secret to `true`.

To enable step debug logging set the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true`.
